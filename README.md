# Java-Fundamentals
1.create a class with Strings declared String s = "Hello" and String s1= "Hello" and String s2= new String("Hello") and evaluate s==s1 and s1==s2.
2.Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
					3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
					2.1x + .55y = 5.9
3.Design a shape hierarchy (circle, rectangle, and triangle) with a common interface for calculating area. Create a method that takes an array of shapes and prints the area of each shape without knowing the specific type of each shape at compile time.
4.Model a company's employee hierarchy. Define a base class for employees with common attributes (name, ID, salary) and methods. Create subclasses for different types of employees (full-time, part-time, and contract) with specific attributes and methods
5.Simulate a vehicle manufacturing system where you have different types of vehicles (car, bike, and truck) and different features (electric, hybrid, diesel). Implement classes using multiple inheritance to handle various combinations of vehicle types and features.
Interface1 : FuelType
interface 2 : VehicleType
base Class: Vehicle
Child classes : Car, Bike implemnts 2 interface and extends 1 class
